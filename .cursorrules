# Project Cursor Rules

- Angular (v19+): Prefer standalone components. New Angular components should be created as `standalone: true` and declare their own `imports` rather than relying on NgModules.
- Shared UI primitives should be implemented as standalone components and, if needed by NgModules, included via the NgModule `imports` and re-exported from `exports`.
- Avoid declaring standalone components in `declarations` of any NgModule. Standalone components must be added to the NgModule `imports` (and `exports` if they should be available to consumers).

# Cursor Rules for SMX Tournament Database

## General Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript for frontend code (Angular)
- Use JavaScript (Node.js) for backend API code
- Use MySQL for database operations
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages

## Code Quality

- Write clean, maintainable code
- Add appropriate error handling
- Include necessary validation
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic when necessary

## Database

- Use the existing database schema structure
- Follow the naming conventions (snake_case for database, camelCase for JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## Frontend (Angular)

- Use Angular reactive forms
- Follow Angular best practices and style guide
- Use Material Design components where appropriate
- Implement proper form validation
- Handle loading states appropriately
- **DO NOT use arrow functions in Angular template files** - Angular templates do not support arrow functions. Instead, create component methods to handle any complex logic or transformations needed in templates

## Backend (Node.js/Express)

- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Validate request data before processing
- Use middleware for authentication and authorization

## Important: No Backward Compatibility

**DO NOT add code for backward compatibility. When making changes that break existing functionality, update all affected code paths rather than maintaining compatibility with old data structures or APIs.**

## Testing

- Test changes thoroughly before committing
- Verify both frontend and backend functionality
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Git

- Create focused, atomic commits
- Write clear commit messages explaining what and why

## Code Reusability (DRY Principle)

- **DO NOT repeat or duplicate code across multiple places**
- Reuse existing components, services, utilities, and shared logic wherever possible
- Extract common functionality into reusable services, components, or utility functions
- Keep shared/reusable code in appropriate shared modules or utility files
- Before implementing new functionality, check if similar functionality already exists that can be extended or reused
- When multiple components need similar features, create shared components or services rather than duplicating code
